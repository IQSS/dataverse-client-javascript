# Use Cases

In the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a use case is a specific way to describe and capture a user's or system's interaction with the domain to achieve a particular goal. 

This package exposes the functionality in the form of use cases, with the main goal that any package consumer can easily identify the desired functionality.
